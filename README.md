<!-- QUESTIONS -->

## Questions

### What was my experience doing this challenge? üêà

_I am very newbie on this coding world but i like to try my skills on a challenge, Figma is a powerfull tool for developers/non designers, helps a lot to setting up a guide so you can have all your ideas in order and a clear path to develop. I feel very excited with this challenge and i hope you enjoy reading this code, give me some feedback on twitter i'll give you my username below._

### What have i learned/improved? üêà

_I feel a bit more comfortable understanding the code that i read and i feel a bit more confident using figma, I know i have a long way in order to use more simplified things on my coding but i think is a good start, this is my second project i hope i get more experience_

### My wisdom? üêà

Try and dare, sometimes you feel a bit lost but if you don't give up and stay focus reading the docs and practicing what you read you get there.
